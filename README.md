### Description
Scatter plots are sets of matrices using cartesian coordinates to visualize data for a collection of points with two or more attributes.
For `n` attributes, there should be `nxn` plots. Here, we are reading 6D points which yields 36 matrices. Using scatter plots is easy to visualize comparison of an attribute to other attributes.
