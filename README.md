### Description
Scatter plots are sets of matrices using cartesian coordinates to visualize data for a collection of points with two or more attributes.
For `n` attributes, there should be `nxn` plots. Here, we are reading 6D points, which yields 36 matrices. Using scatter plots makes it easy to visualize comparisons between attributes.

### Testing

1. Clone the repo or download the [`.zip`](https://github.com/zemahran/scatter-plotting/archive/master.zip) file.
> https://github.com/zemahran/scatter-plotting.git
2. In Visual Studio, open the project solution named "OpenGL2DTemplate".
3. Build and run the "scatterplot.cpp" file.
